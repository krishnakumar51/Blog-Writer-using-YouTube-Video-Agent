In this video, we will learn how to determine the period, group, valency, and oxidation number of any element. Starting with the period, for any element that comes in, its period number will depend on the number of shells it has. For example, let's take Sodium as an example. The electronic configuration of Sodium is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s², which has a total of three shells. So, its period number will be 3.

Next, let's consider Calcium. If we calculate its electronic configuration and find that it is 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s², which has a total of four shells. Therefore, the period number of Calcium will be 4.

Moving on to the discussion of groups, we divide elements into three parts - complete filled shells, incomplete outermost shell, and incomplete innermost shell. For example, elements with complete filled shells belong to Group A, where the group number is determined by the number of valence electrons. For instance, if an element has 10 valence electrons, it belongs to Group A.

When it comes to determining valency, we can calculate it by counting the number of electrons in the outermost and innermost shells. By adding the number of unpaired electrons in the outermost shell and multiplying it by the number of unpaired electrons in the innermost shell, we can determine the valency of the element.

Lastly, let's discuss oxidation numbers. For elements in the S and P blocks, the oxidation number varies from +1 to +6. For example, elements in Group 1 have an oxidation number of +1, while elements in Group 2 have an oxidation number of +2. The oxidation number is always positive and never goes into negative values.

In conclusion, understanding the trick to find out the period, group, valency, and oxidation number of elements can provide valuable insights into the properties and behavior of different elements on the periodic table.
